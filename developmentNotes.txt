When clone laravel project from team github repo, what need to do?
1. Clone the repo:
    git clone https://github.com/your-team/your-laravel-project.git
    cd your-laravel-project
2. Install dependencies
    composer install
3. Set up environment file (copy the example env file to create a new .env file)
    cp .env.example .env
4. Generate application key
    php artisan key:generate
5. Configure .env file
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
    DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
    DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
6. Set up database (after db is created and credentials must match those in .env file, then run migration)
    php artisan migrate
    php artisan db::seed
7. Install and build frontend assets 
    npm install
    npm run dev
8. Serve the application
    php artisan Serve

Q&A

- during development process: 
    - run frontend: php artisan serve
    - run backend: open xampp and run apache & mysql
- how to see database:
    - http://localhost/phpmyadmin/

- how to configured route to a webpage:
    - web.php: define route
    - Controller.php: define the method
    - new blade.php: configure the ui
    - prev blade.php: update the route to the subsequent webpage
